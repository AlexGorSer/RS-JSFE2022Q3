Hello, my name is Alexey Gromov, but you can call me Alex. I am a junior front end developer.
My nickname on github is AlexGorSer.
I have a secondary liberal arts education and am currently a student of the RSSchool frontend course.

In the RSSchool courses, I gained skills in working with Git, GitHub, HTML and CSS, JS, Figma, DevTool, node.js,
webpack, SASS, bootstrap, and some TypeScript.
And I hope to acquire even more skills on this platform.

Strong side in sociability and friendliness in the team.
Weakness: I am very bad at solving algorithmic problems, I solve them for a very long time, but I am trying to develop this necessary skill.

What I liked the most was learning how to solve the same problem in different ways,
and also try to implement your code differently than others write.
True, this does not always work out correctly and often you have to rewrite everything from scratch.

My future plans are to try to become a game developer to create new colorful worlds and also improve my algorithmic problem solving skills.

The most interesting task during the course was the momentum task, many interesting features and a pretty nice application.
One of the most difficult was the task of the tag, I implemented the wrong algorithm and made it so that each new output of the function made listeners to the elements of the DOM tree again. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to redo the task, but perhaps I will return to it in the future when I gain more knowledge.


The last task called Songbird turned out to be very interesting, the first time I tried a wonderful framework called Bootstrap on it, it helped me a lot in developing and simplifying the code. Now I understand why we were forbidden to use it until this moment, otherwise the students would not understand what is under the hood of this framework. I encountered during this task the point of translating the application into another language, I built an algorithm so that it will not be able to translate the main block of the task, at the time of the creation of this video, I have not yet solved this problem. And also for the first time I incorrectly hung listeners on audio elements with my own player,
I remade it into a cycle and everything worked out for me, I understand that the error is obvious, but it happened that way.

In general, my training is very cheerful and fast enough, but not without problems. I hope that I can achieve my goal and become a good developer.


Thank you for watching!
